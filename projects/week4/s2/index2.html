<p id="hunt">
  <p>
There are more than 3,000 species of
snakes <br/>on the planet and they’re
found everywhere except in Antarctica,<br/>
Iceland, Ireland, Greenland, and <br/>
New Zealand. About 600 species are venomous, and only about 200—seven
percent—are able to kill or significantly wound a <b class="bd">human</b>.<br>
<hr>
Snakes also have forked tongues, which they flick in different directions to smell their surroundings. That lets them know when danger—or food—is nearby.
Snakes have several other ways to detect a snack. <br/>
Openings called pit holes in front of their eyes sense <br/>
the heat given off by warm-blooded prey. <br/>
And bones in their lower jaws pick up vibrations from rodents<br/>
and other scurrying animals. When they do capture prey, <br/>
snakes can eat animals up to three times bigger than their head is <br/>
wide because their lower jaws unhinge from their upper jaws. <br/>
Once in a snake’s mouth, the prey is held in place by teeth that face<br/>
inward, trapping it there.<br/>

<h1 id="sea">Sea snakes</h1>
<p>

Most snakes live on land, but there are about 70 species of <br/>
snakes that live in the Indian and Pacific oceans. <br/>
Sea snakes and their cousins, kraits, are some of <br/>
the most venomous snakes that exist, but they pose <br/>
little threat to humans because they’re shy, gentle, <br/>
and their fangs are too short to do much damage.<br/>
