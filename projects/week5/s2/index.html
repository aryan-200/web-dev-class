      <h2>birds</h2>
      <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded <br>
        vertebrates constituting the class <br>
        Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterised by feathers<br>
        , toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled <br>
        eggs, a high metabolic rate, a <br>
        four-chambered heart, and a strong <br>
        yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live <br>
        worldwide and range in size from the <br>
        5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to <br>
        the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There <br>

      <h2>more information</h2>
      <p> are about ten thousand living species, more than half of <br>
        which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose <br>
        development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are <br>
        the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from <br>
        forelimbs, gave birds the ability to <br>
        fly, although further evolution has<br>
        led to the loss of flight in some <br>
        birds, including ratites, penguins, <br>
        and diverse endemic island species. <br>
        The digestive and respiratory systems <br>
        of birds are also uniquely adapted <br>
        for flight. Some bird species of <br>
        aquatic environments, particularly <br>
        seabirds and some waterbirds, have <br>
        further evolved for swimming.<br>
